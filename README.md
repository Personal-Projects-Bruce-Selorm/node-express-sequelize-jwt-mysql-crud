# node-express-sequelize-jwt-mysql-crud
Welcome to my repository where I've built a simple CRUD application using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, JWT, and Sequelize with MySQL as the database dialect. This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete records in a MySQL database.

The application uses the JWT authentication mechanism to protect certain routes and ensure secure access to data. I've also utilized Sequelize, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, to define database models and manage database operations.

This repository includes all the necessary files, including the server-side code, configuration files, and views built using EJS templating. I've also included a clear and concise README file that provides instructions on how to set up and run the application on your local machine.

Feel free to clone and explore the repository to see how I've implemented the CRUD functionality and used various technologies to build a simple yet powerful web application

Node.js CRUD app w/ JWT auth &amp; MySQL. Built with Express &amp; Sequelize. Clone &amp; run locally using npm start command. See README for setup instructions.
